        "comment": "Lina-Marija cabin is a true paradise for lovers of pristine nature, hiking, and tranquility. It is located in untouched nature, yet still easily accessible. The cabin is surrounded by fragrant coniferous forest and overlooks meadows, offering complete peace and a deep connection with nature.\nWe especially enjoyed long walks and hikes — the trails start directly from the house’s yard, are easily accessible, and lead through diverse landscapes (along a stream, across bare hills, and through fragrant coniferous woods. You might encounter horses, as well as various wild and domestic animals.",

        "comment": "The place is magical, wonderful, and looks much, much better than you can see in the photos. The surroundings are beautiful, and the interior is very cozy.\nI usually rent accommodation just to spend the night and continue my adventure, as was the case this time. But the place is so peaceful and lovely that I’m sure we’ll come back for a longer stay just to enjoy it. Thanks to Radovan and his wife for such a great place to stay.",

        "comment": "A very comfortable, modern house in a remote location — surrounded by peace, quiet, and harmony with nature. The house had everything needed for everyday life. Everything — the house itself, the dishes, the linens — was clean and fresh. The internet worked perfectly. In short, everything needed for a comfortable stay was there. But honestly, even if there had been nothing at all, this place is so healing, so peaceful and beautiful, that everything else fades into the background.\nI especially want to mention the hosts. Radovan and Helga are incredibly kind, open, and warm-hearted people. I wholeheartedly recommend staying here — this is truly a special place.",
